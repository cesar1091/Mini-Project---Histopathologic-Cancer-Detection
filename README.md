## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of histopathologic images of lymph node sections. The data is divided into training, validation, and test sets. [Include any links or references to the dataset if applicable].

## Installation
To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Model Training: Use the Experiment.ipynb notebook to train the model on the preprocessed data.
Model Training and Evaluation
The project uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification. The training and evaluation processes are detailed in the respective Jupyter Notebooks.

## Model Training and Evaluation
The project uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification. The training and evaluation processes are detailed in the respective Jupyter Notebooks. You can validate your results using Kaggle's platform by submitting the predictions to the competition.

## Results
The results of the model, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, are documented in the Experiment.ipynb notebook. [Include any visualizations or specific metrics here if available].
